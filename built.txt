PocketWealth — Dependencies and Assets (Final v1.0.0)
Updated: 2025-10-29

Purpose
-------
This document lists the runtime dependencies, assets, and data files used by the PocketWealth website and demo app so maintainers understand what the site needs to run.

Runtime dependencies (no build tools required)
----------------------------------------------
External libraries loaded via CDN:
- Chart.js (for charts on marketing pages, Dashboard, Market detail, Robo ESG, and Admin)
	• Typical CDN: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js
- React + ReactDOM (UMD) — used by the Paper Trading Game and mini-quiz components
	• Typical CDN: https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js
	• Typical CDN: https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js

Browser APIs used (no polyfills required for modern browsers):
- localStorage (user accounts, sessions, market series, achievements)
- DOM APIs (query selectors, events, CustomEvent for cross-component notifications)
- Date/Intl APIs for formatting
 - sessionStorage (Assistant chat history for current page session)

Internal modules (no external packages):
- assets/js/app.js — app shell, auth/session, navigation, premium toggle, admin, activity
- assets/js/charts.js — marketing/overview charts (Chart.js wrapper)
- assets/js/market.js (if present inside app.js) — simulated market loop and UI wiring
- assets/js/paper-trading-game.js — Paper Trading Game, Achievements, Risk vs Reward Simulator
- assets/js/app-page.js / app-core.js — page-level glue (tab switching, helpers)
 - PocketWealth Assistant (chatbot) — implemented in `assets/js/app-core.js`, rule-based intents; no external AI services or libraries

Backend (optional) runtime dependencies
--------------------------------------
If you choose to run the teaching backend located in `server/`:
- express ^4.18.2 — HTTP server and routing
- cors ^2.8.5 — Cross-origin resource sharing (enabled for local dev)
- lowdb ^5.0.0 — Lightweight JSON database (`server/data/db.json`)
- bcrypt ^5.1.0 — Password hashing (10 rounds)
- nanoid ^4.0.0 — ID generation

Quick start (backend)
---------------------
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
# Server: http://localhost:5173
```

Styles and UI
-------------
- assets/css/styles.css — marketing site styles and shared utilities
- assets/css/app.css — in-app styles (tabs, cards, widgets)
- assets/css/app-page.css — page and component-level polish
- Utility-like class names are defined in the CSS (no Tailwind build step)

Assets
------
- SVG/logo: assets/img/logo-wallet.svg, assets/img/chainstack-logo-wrapper.svg
- Illustrations: assets/img/learning-hero-cute.svg and others
- Favicons: assets/img/favicons/

Data files (JSON)
-----------------
- data/demo.json — marketing/demo KPIs for charts
- data/etfs.json — ETF info used by app modules
- data/fees.json — fee schedules used by DIY trading
- data/demo-portfolios.json — sample recommended portfolios
- data/learning.json — learning content for app
- data/market.json (if present) — market seed/snapshot
- data/impact.json — premium impact demo data

Hosting requirements
--------------------
- Any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3/CloudFront) or local file system
- If loading JSON via fetch, serve over HTTP(S) using a static server
 - If using the backend, run it separately (default http://localhost:5173); CORS is enabled for local development.

Browser support (tested manually)
---------------------------------
- Chrome (latest), Safari (latest on macOS), Edge (latest)
- Mobile Safari (latest iOS) — responsive layouts validated

How to update dependencies
--------------------------
- Chart.js: update the CDN URL version if needed; ensure charts still render
- React/ReactDOM: keep UMD builds in sync (same major/minor)
- No lockfiles or package.json are present — updates are manual via HTML includes

Notes
-----
- Primarily a client-side demo. An optional backend is available under `server/`.
- To reset demo data, clear site data (localStorage) in the browser.
